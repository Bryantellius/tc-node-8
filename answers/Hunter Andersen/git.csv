General Git Commands
'git init', creates a repo in the current working directory
'git add .', adds any changes to the staged area
'git commit', commits (saves) a change to the history on the local machine
'git push', send the committed changes to the remote repo for collaboration

Git Branching / Merging
'git branch', will tell me which branches I have and which one I'm on
'git branch <branch_name>', will create a new branch
'git checkout <branch_name>', will switch me onto a different branch
'git status', will still be helpful to see where I'm at
'git commit', will still commit changes
'git push', will now fail on the first push on a new branch
	Option 1. Be explicit every time we push
		'git push origin <branch_name>'
	Option 2. Set the new default upstream
		'git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
Now the default git push will use this branch

Git Conflict Visualization
'git diff', quickly shows differences
'git log --graph', shows text-based graph of commits
'git show', combines diff and log to show the most info

'git pull', updates my local branch with a remote repo (Github)
